# Learn C++ Programming By Making Games

### Section 01 Raise the curtain
In this course, we are going to see how to create 2D arcade games from scratch.

### Section 02 Get to class
In this section we'll remember a little bit about classes and how objects are just tools we use to solve problems.

### Section 03 The particulars
In this section we cover a little more about class, constructor initialization, destructor, scope and pointer.
